The [Political Compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/) was created in 2001 with the goal of being able to represent political ideologies on a simple 2d graph. Its x-axis represents economic ideology (left to right-wing economics) whereas the y-axis measures social freedom. The following leads to four main ideological quadrants: authoritarian left, authoritarian right, libertarian left, and libertarian right.

One of the biggest criticisms of the Political Compass is that it measures something as complex as political ideologies on only two measures. This not only tended to bias results towards the “libertarian left” quadrant but also leave a lot of the user’s beliefs up to interpretation. 

[8Values](https://github.com/8values/8values.github.io#readme) sought to correct this by breaking up the broad social and economic Political Compass axes into eight more specific beliefs spanning across four ideological scales: Equality vs Markets, Nation vs World, Liberty vs Authority, and Tradition vs Progress.

After taking the 70 question quiz, these four scales are graphed on a horizontal bar chart to get a better sense of the user’s political beliefs.

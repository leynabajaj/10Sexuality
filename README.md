The [Political Compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/) was created in 2001 with the goal of being able to represent political ideologies on a simple 2d graph. Its x-axis represents economic ideology (left to right-wing economics) whereas the y-axis measures social freedom. The following leads to four main ideological quadrants: authoritarian left, authoritarian right, libertarian left, and libertarian right.

This is what the Political Compass might define someone who is libertarian left as. 


One of the biggest criticisms of the Political Compass is that it measures something as complex as political ideologies on only two measures. This not only tended to bias results towards the “libertarian left” quadrant but also leave a lot of the user’s beliefs up to interpretation. 

[8Values](https://github.com/8values/8values.github.io#readme) sought to correct this by breaking up the broad social and economic Political Compass axes into eight more specific beliefs spanning across four ideological scales: Equality vs Markets, Nation vs World, Liberty vs Authority, and Tradition vs Progress.

After taking the 70 question quiz, these four scales are graphed on a horizontal bar chart to get a better sense of the user’s political beliefs.

Our libertarian left person from before's beliefs are more well-defined on 8Values.

We recommend you check out their [quiz](https://8values.github.io/) to get a better sense of how it works.

## This Quiz
This quiz is a fork of the 8Values [repo](https://github.com/8values/). It seeks to do what 8Values did to political beliefs but with sexuality. 

It is to the belief of the people who contributed to this quiz that sexuality can be measured along several different independent identities (not quite values) split upon several axes.

While we are still working out what these identities should be, we believe this is a better way to talk about sexuality as terms like “bisexual” while helpful do not tell the whole story. This project is currently a work in progress and in infancy.

Stay tuned for more details!
